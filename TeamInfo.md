## Project Summary

[CNBC] (https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/07/coronavirus-why-most-people-still-arent-buying-travel-insurance.html) estimates that more than 50% of Americans do not buy flight insurance for their non-refundable flights while traveling anywhere around the world. Furthermore, passengers who do not rely on booking agents are less likely to opt in for insurance.  In the US, there are 330 million people, which means that 165 million of them are in a situation where they might benefit from having flight insurance. Missed flights, canceled trips, and sudden medical issues are a few examples of these situations. In some circumstances, people were also required to pay extra  for alternative transportation or lodging incase of missed or delayed flights. Some of the common reasons why people avoid purchasing flight insurance are because they either consider it to be overly pricey, or they assume they won't require it, or they are unaware of what the insurance plan covers. 

Now, here in our project we have chosen to target and solve the “they assume they won’t require it” problem statement. We will be tackling this problem statement by utilizing the  flight delays data set to predict which flights would be delayed in the future and potentially also suggest to the user whether or not they should be purchasing the insurance based on the predicted probability of their flight being delayed or canceled due to the various unprecedented reasons. We also partially target and suggest other possibilities to the “ they either consider it to be overly pricey” problem statement. If the user does not wish to pay for insurance, we also provide them with a personalized list of recommendations of the airlines they should choose to minimize their risk of facing circumstances due to the delays and cancellations.
